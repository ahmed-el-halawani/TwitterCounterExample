# TwitterCounter Assigment

## Notes
  1- Key Properties File: The key.properties file was not added to .gitignore to facilitate testing of the application.  

  2- Twitter Text Library: I utilized the Twitter Text library, which is provided by Twitter.  
  This library was chosen because Twitter employs specific criteria for text analysis.   
  Unlike standard methods that count special characters and regular characters, Twitter's library also includes its own list of characters that are counted as two.  

  3- Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection (DI) was not implemented in this project as it is relatively small and does not require it.  
  However, the principles of Dependency Inversion have been adhered to.
